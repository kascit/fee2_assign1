        <div class="disc"><b>Review:</b>Fitzgerald, you have ruined me.

            Fitzgerald can set a scene so perfectly, flawlessly. He paints a world of magic and introduces one of the greatest characters of all time, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is the embodiment of hope, and no one can dissuade him from his dreams. Have you ever had a dream that carried you to heights you could never have dreamed otherwise? When Gatsby is reunited with Daisy Buchanan, he fills the space to the brim with flowers, creating a living dream. How is anyone supposed to compete with that?
            
            The Great Gatsby perfectly makes use of a narrator, Nick. Why is Gatsby so great? Because Nick tells us. If Gatsby told us, we would just think that he is a braggard, the least humble person in the world.
            
            This book is wildly addictive, so intricate yet perfectly woven together, a brilliant literary masterpiece. I have to keep going back to reconnect with Jay Gatsby, a naïve but beautiful and charming hope, perfectly imperfect, a relentless dreamer.

And then the Zombie outbreak arrives!! Just how would this apocalyptic world changing event affect their own personal relationship as well as the fate of the whole world? - well America's West coast first, I suppose.
            This is a fun-filled, modern day, good old-fashioned Zombie romp containing an abundance of all the usual trimmings that the reader would come to expect - lots of blood, lots of gore, lots of killings, lots of thrills, lots of spills and finally, but definitely not least,...lots and lots of fun! Written in a humorous fashion with lots of great characters, sparkling wit and great dialogue, this is one stereotypical Zombie adventure/journey surely not to be missed. So why not escape the harsh world of reality for a while and go enjoy this piece of pure undead rattling good fun - you won't be disappointed.</p></div>

        <div class="disc"><b>Review:</b> I have been on a zombie reading frenzy lately – I see a zombie book and I must read it, I can’t help myself. And the books are coming fast and furious, especially in the YA area. Some are good, some are awful, and some are outstanding. Jonathan Maberry’s Rot and Ruin falls somewhere just shy of outstanding. It reeks of EPIC WIN.</p></div>

        </div><div class="disc"><b>Review:</b>This one was a confusing ride because I didn't like it?? but I also didn't dislike it???
            What I can say is that Feed definitely had an impact on me (to the point where I had zombie nightmares) and I didn't want to put it down at any point - but I'm ultimately confused about what this book wanted to be.
            The general gist is that we're following 3 bloggers who are selected to shadow and report on a presidential campaign... in a zombie apocalypse. Or not apocalypse I guess because the world doesn't end. The narrative is a kind of emotionless report of the presidential campaign with a smidge of witty aside, which fits the voice of our main character, a blogger... And the zombies just kind of exist.
            The focus of this was definitely on the political plot, making this feel like more of a speculative "how would America continue in the aftermath of a zombie outbreak" than a zombie novel, and it weirdly had a bit of a noir feel to it more than dystopian or horror.
            I am low-key intrigued to continue the series but this first one, while compelling, really just confused me.</p>

        <b>Review:</b> There isn't a lot of violence but what there is is pretty brutal. The hacking was pretty well done and not completely unbelievable. I guess what really sold the book for me was that I really believed in the characters. Both of them are pretty flawed but completely believable.

I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a some complaints. Aside from the pace, I felt like Larsson threw in some needless details. I didn't need to know the brands of a lot of products or what the characters were eating. I also thought that Mikael Blomkvist being a sort of James Bond in regard to the ladies was a tad unbelievable. Honestly, those are my only two complaints I can think of at the moment.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo deserves a lot of the hype it gets. Now go out and read it if you haven't already!</div>

        <div class="disc"><b>Review:</b> Masterful!-- As close as there is to a SOAP OPERA for MEN. The need for reinvention, as well as the necessity to keep things in line with tradition are explored fully. Interesting to note are: the general absence of Fredo, the omnipresence of Johnny Fontaine... the Hollywood sex parties in detail (and how's this for risqué [& appropriate to the season]: Best Actor & Best Actress in public sex), plus invaluable insights (like the entire Book V, largely absent from the beloved film) as bizarre as sexual readjustment surgeries and as natural as mob allegiances in Vegas. This is pure entertainment-- decadence for the reader at full throttle!!!! This is a classic train of portraits of a kingdom in steep decline, of its vindication and revolution, rife with those beloved Shakespearean precepts like corruption, revenge & fate.</p></div><br><br><div class="container">

        <div class="disc"><b>Review:</b> Dystopian Perfection.

            In a post-apocalyptic future, life has turned extremely hard. Fighting poverty and hunger every day, sixteen years old hunter Katniss does absolutely everything in her power to have enough for her defenseless little sister, and a barely lucid mother. Life is hard, yet not impossible, until the one fateful day arrives. Once every year, the ever vigilant all powerful Capitol of Panem celebrates for their entertainment the “Hunger Games”, a yearly tournament where a handful representatives of each district are forced to fight in a massive arena, to the death. In a sad turn of events, young Katniss will have to fight not only for herself, but for the future of her starving family.
            
            I think this series needs as much introduction as Lord of the Rings; but what the hey, old habits die hard. Maybe not everyone has read it, maybe not everyone has watched it, but doubt anyone has never heard of it at some point. One of the greatest dystopian fiction of all time, or at least one of the best-selling ones. A literature masterpiece? Hardly. One of the most entertaining ever? Quite possibly! Astounding world building and character development. Not a profound reading at all, but a plot perfectly balanced, fast paced and action packed; if you can withstand YA that is, and the triangle thingy. Along with Percy Jackson and Divergent, one of the pillar series that sparked my literary addiction. Highly Recommendable.</div>
